# Quote

## A dedicated and intimate platform for sharing moments through quotes.

### Quote is, at it's simplest, a stripped down social media app which jettisons all of the extravagence bundled with the most popular sites, leaving behind a modest yet elegant medium for users to connect with one another. 

### It distinguishes itself from other apps by putting the focus on those whom one 'quotes,' taking the spotlight off the poster. As a result, it promotes honesty and ownership without promoting ego.

## Quote is a work in progress and is not yet hosted on any site. This is simply the github repo to track changes as the project becomes more complicated, and to share an insight as to how my coding mind operates.
